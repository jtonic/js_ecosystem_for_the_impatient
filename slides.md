JS ecosystem for the impatient
---

<div style="text-align=left">
Without a doubt, since quite some time, javascript (JS) became one of the most popular language.

Its reign came from its *language of the web* nature.
</div>

<!--s-->

Because of its huge popularity, in time, it started to conquer some other peaks such as:
- backend development (NodeJS, ExpressJS),
- tooling (npm/yarn, webpack, gulp, grunt),
- mobile (Xamarim, React Native, Cordova),
- desktop (Electron, Atom, Visual Studio Code),
- presentation (RevealJS, Reveal-md)

Note: This is a speaker note, you need node 8.x installed
