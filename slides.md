JS ecosystem for the impatient
===

Without a doubt since quite some time a JS became one of the most popular language. Its reign came from its "language of the web" nature.

In time, because its huge popularity, it started to conquer some other peaks such as:
- backend development (NodeJS, ExpressJS),
- tooling (npm/yarn, webpack, gulp, grunt),
- mobile (Xamarim, React Native, Cordova),
- desktop (Electron, Athom, Visual Studio Code),
- presentation (RevealJS, Reveal-md)

Note: This is a speaker note, you need node 8.x installed
