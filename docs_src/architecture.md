# Software architecture

## What is software architecture

## Hexagonal architecture

Hexagonal architecture is the alternative name for the architecture based on the adapters and ports pattern.

TBD

### Practical example

### When to use it?

In my opinion it should not be used in simple/small application, such as a simple crude based applications or a simple micro-service, where the complexity brought by this architecture is not justified.

It depends... TBD
