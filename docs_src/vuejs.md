# VueJS

---

It is quite clear to the reader that I am new in this huge JS realm/galaxy.
But it is clear that almost any developer heard these days about the Angular, React and (most recently) VueJS.
I was not at all an exception, so one question that I asked myself
\_Why did I decide to start learning VueJS considering Angular and React were on the marked for some time and became the most popular tools for developing SPA?\*
The answer is straightforward.
I joined the **One app 3 frameworks** Voxxed Days Bucharest Frontend 2019 workshop.
The workshop was about written the same web applications in Angular, React and Vue.
The presenter who talked about the Vue started his presentation (more or less) with
"I am mainly a BE developer and was looking for a simple web library/frontend for developing the web application. After looking getting my feet wet with all 3 popular frameworks it was clear to me it is Vue I have to go further with".
I found myself in the same situation as VueJS presenter, and considering the explanations I was given by him about why did he consider VueJS as a best option for developing web, I decided to start learning Vue.
