The sole purpose of this book is to keep in writing what I am learning about the JS technologies, languages, libraries, frameworks (the JS ecosystem) so that I can reference it whenever I have to.

I am new to this realm so **it is high likelihood that some of my personal interpretation won't be aligned with a more professional one**. So please take it as is or file in an github issue about the problem to remedy it.

Moreover, english is not my mother tongue so I expect a significant number of english grammar and wording problems as well.

> Note: The material inside this book represents my personal interpretation of what I am learning during the learning journey.
