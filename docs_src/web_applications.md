# Web applications

---

Web application in the browser without any doubt is one of the most popular type of applications.
During the last decades the web application architecture (approach) evolved tremendously from the request per page to SPA (WPA).
Gone were days when a Web Application were a suite of pages and navigation from one to the next meant reloading an entirely new html page.
I remember that back then:

- server side was the responsible for providing the data + presentation (html/css/js)
- getting new data meant reloading the same page (with different data) or a complete new page altogether.
- JavaScript was used solely for just some minor user interactions or some basic effects.

In time the way the web application FE part it has undergone major changes, a lot of useful libraries (QueryJS), specifications (AJAX) and frameworks (AngularJS) have rose and vanished.
The approach also has been switched from page per request to SinglePageApplication (AJAX).
Moreover the fact smartphones became so popular and browser so performant both on desktop and mobile the common requirements set enlarged (responsive application, PWA - progressive web application).

Nowadays web application tendencies are:

- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- Micro Frontends

### Capabilities of modern web applications

- responsiveness (responsive applications)
- progressive
- good support for persons with disabilities
- runs performantly both on desktop and mobile devices

**Over a tons of web libraries/framewoks exists nowadays there are 3 that reigns.**

- Angular (web framework) - developed by Google Inc.
- ReactJS (web library) - developed by Facebook Inc.
- VueJS - developed by community.

### There are also WEB specifications

**Web Components**

Their intents are:

- relief the web developer from the "learn another framework" tiredness
- standardize the market trends
- supported by major browsers natively
- be common denominator for micro frontends (angular, react, vue components exposed as Web Components and used in the same application)
- allow the application to be split/aggregated in/from independent components (developed by small teams). This is just a more-or-less equivalent of BE micro-services.
