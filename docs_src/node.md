## What is node.js?

node.js is a JavaScript that runs on backend. 

It is well-known that Javascript was invented to run on a browser (it is the language of the web), but in time, thanks to huge popularity of web browsers/applications JavaScript evolved from that tiny language to run in browser to a huge ecosystem, for which node.js play an important role. 

node.js could be used to:
- start a http(s) web browser
- call http exposed services (REST service)
- read/write content on the filesystem
- create and manage OS processes
- write/query data to/from databases (RDBMS or NoSQL)
- and a lot more... 

The runtime of node.js is based on Google's V8 Javascript Engine.
This is the same engine used by Google's Chrome JS runtime.
