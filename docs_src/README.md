JS ecosystem for the impatient
___

Without a doubt JS became (since quite some time) one of the most popular language. Its reign came from its "language of the web" nature.

In time, because its huge popularity, it started to conquer some other peaks such as:
- backend development (NodeJS, ExpressJS),
- tooling (npm/yarn, webpack, gulp, grunt),
- mobile (Xamarim, React Native, Cordova),
- desktop (Electron, Athom, Visual Studio Code),
- presentation (RevealJS, Reveal-md)
