# JS ecosystem for the impatient

---

Without a doubt JS became (since quite some time) one of the most popular language.
Its reign came from its "language of the web" nature.

In time, because its huge popularity, it started to conquer some other peaks such as:

- backend development (NodeJS, ExpressJS),
- tooling (npm/yarn, webpack, gulp, grunt),
- mobile (React Native, Xamarim, Cordova),
- desktop (Electron, Atom, Visual Studio Code),
- presentation (RevealJS, Reveal-md, Gitbook)

This book is about explaining at some extent some of the most popular citizens of the JS ecosystem/kingdom.
Because the main target of the book is myself I am going to have different approach during book writing, cookbook/how to is the main one.
Personally I like the _in Action_ style of the manning publisher, so you could observe the same style in this book. With this style one could dive in any chapter about a topic he/she needs to get more information about, without being required to read all previous chapters.
